cooworker or a friend advanced voice

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,840
uses our natively multimodal 40 model

75
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,400
that means it takes in your audio

76
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,799
directly understands it and outputs

77
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:12,680
audio directly as a result conversations

78
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,920
with advanced voice have a much more

79
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,640
natural conversation Pace with a depth

80
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,519

course of the next week we'll be rolling

83
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,040
out video and screen share in advanced

84
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,959
voice so that you can share realtime

85
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,519
visual content with chubbt to make your

86
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,519

87
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,599

88
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,000

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,599
together in real time you can ask for

91
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,560
help troubleshoot or use it to learn

92
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,280
something new so in fact I'm going to

93
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,280
try testing out right now I'm going to

94
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,519
have it uh teach me how to make pourover

95
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,560
coffee so I'm going to grab a couple of

96
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,200
materials

97
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,720
here grab this and that and then I'm

98
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,439
going to fire up a new conversation with

99
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,159
chat

100
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,000
gbt and hit the advanced voice mode icon

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,480
on the lower

102
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,599

103
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,640
share my video hey chat how's it

104
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,840
going I'm doing great thanks for asking

105
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,798
I see you're wearing a Santa hat I am

106
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,959
and do you see what I have in front of

107
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,800
me yes I see a coffee set up with a

108
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,919
kettle and a dripper are you planning to

109
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:26,840
make some coffee I'd love to do you

110
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,880
think you could walk me through the

111
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,960
steps

112
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,840
sure I'd love to first place a filter in

113
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,759
the dripper and rinse it with hot water

114
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:37,600
to eliminate any papery taste this also

115
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,840
warms up the dripper and the mug great

116
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,440
so then what do I

117
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,240
do next you'll add your ground coffee to

118
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,039
the filter usually about 2 tablespoons

119
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:50,039
for every 6 oz of water then you'll

120
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,320
gently pour a small amount of hot water

121
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,759
onto the grounds to let them bloom for

122
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,360
about 30 seconds great thanks what's

123
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,000
bloom bloom blooming allows the coffee

124
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,280
to release gas and enhances the flavor

125
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,759
after blooming slowly pour the rest of

126
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:09,360
the hot water in a circular motion keep

127
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,479
the water level consistent and let it

128
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,400
drip through the coffee grounds into

129
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,479
your mug cool that sounds great I'll do

130
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,199
the pouring

131
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,240
now awesome take your time and pour

132
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,880
slowly this helps the water extract the

133
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,560
coffee evenly for better flavor anything

134
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,960
I could be doing different or better

135
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,280
about my

136
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,319
technique your technique looks good just

137
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,800
keep a steady gentle pour and make sure

138
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
the coffee grounds remain evenly

139
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,800
saturated you're doing great so far

140
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,000
