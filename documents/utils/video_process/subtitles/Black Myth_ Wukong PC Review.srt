00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,280
hey y' Mitchell Saltzman here I'm the

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,160
reviewer of black myth Wukong and just a

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,120
quick note about this review as part of

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,240
the Embargo agreement set for this game

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,160
I am unable to show you footage Beyond

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,240
chapter 2 which presents a bit of a

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,920
problem because a lot of the technical

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,799
issues that I have with this game that I

9
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:17,840
specifically call out in this review

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,359
occurred after chapter 2 so I'm unable

11
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,080
to actually show them so we're going to

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,199
do two different video reviews this time

13
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,720
this first one will abide by their

14
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,640
restrictions and only show footage from

15
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,720
the first two chapters but we will also

16
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,359
be posting a more complete review with

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,200
the relevant footage added in on launch

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,440
day and with that on with the review for

19
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,960
black myth

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,800
Wukong I've never been so utterly blown

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,640
away yet simultaneously so unbelievably

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,559
frustrated by a game as I have been with

23
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,600
black myth Wukong this is undoubtedly

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,039
one of the most ambitious and impressive

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,600
action games I've played it's stunningly

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,079
gorgeous its combat is fantastic

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,239
it's incredibly challenging but always

28
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,519
satisfying to overcome and the setting

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,560
is refreshingly unique and steeped en

30
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,400
Rich Chinese

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,080
culture despite all of that it often

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,799
feels like it's barely holding it all

33
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,920
together I suffered numerous crashes

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,600
despite having a top-of-the-line set up

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,479
with a gForce RTX 490 not to mention the

36
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,159
multiple times I fell through the ground

37
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,079
and died in the Final Phase of a boss

38
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,640
fight or the way characters would

39
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,799
randomly switch from English to Chinese

40
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,680
or the way the dialogue audio would just

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,560
drop out all together and leave me

42
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,920
completely in the dark during an

43
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,880
important cut scene it's a rickety

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,640
roller coaster for sure and there were

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,759
definitely spots during the ride where I

46
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,240
was not having a great time but taken as

47
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,159
a whole this is one Adventure where the

48
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,040
bumps are worth it

49
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,320
black myth Wukong story is somewhat of a

50
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,159
followup to the classic novel Journey to

51
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,920
the West by Wu changen a book that I

52
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,560
only personally know thanks to very

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,878
loose adaptations like Dragon Ball and

54
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,879
enslaved Odyssey to the West that

55
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,840
surface level familiarity didn't help

56
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,640
much though as the interpretation that

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,120
the developers at game science have

58
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,480
crafted here is Laden with references to

59
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,400
characters and events from the novel

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,959
without doing a great job of bringing

61
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:26,840
you up to speed on who Sun Wukong is or

62
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,360
what he encountered on his titular

63
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,319
journey I had to look online to

64
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,360
understand who zuu baj was what his

65
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,280
history with Wukong is and what the

66
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,280
significance of certain encounters were

67
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,640
because otherwise I'd have been

68
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,640
completely lost at times you play as the

69
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,840
destined one a literal monkey who wakes

70
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,720
up one morning and decides to set out on

71
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,120
a roughly 40-hour journey to locate the

72
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,360
six relics of Wukong while the momentto

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,800
moment storytelling is fairly

74
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,840
unremarkable largely due to a mute

75
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,560
protagonist and Side characters that

76
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,120
aren't given enough screen time to

77
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,159
develop each of the six self-contained

78
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,000
chapters culminates with the stunningly

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,040
gorgeous animated vignette that tells a

80
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,879
short story about that chapter's main

81
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,879
antagonist each one is done in a

82
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,560
completely different art style with one

83
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,519
drawn to look like a story book another

84
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,760
using stop motion animation and another

85
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,799
done in the style of an anime every

86
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:15,400
single one of them is beautiful and

87
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,000
poignant and I couldn't help but wish

88
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,599
that the main story managed to move me

89
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,159
in similar

90
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,680
ways my initial read on Wukong was that

91
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,439
it was a soulslike given the checkpoint

92
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,519
system the stamina bar that governs your

93
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,599
actions in combat and the Dodge heavy

94
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,560
fighting style but as it turns out

95
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,080
Wukong has more in common with

96
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,040
traditional action games like what you

97
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,680
might expect from bayonet developer

98
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,400
Platinum Games than it does with

99
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
anything that from software has made

100
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,319
most of the usual Souls like conventions

101
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,280
are missing there's no penalty for death

102
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,760
outside of respawning at the nearest

103
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,319
checkpoint you don't use a shared

104
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,760
currency to level up your stats and

105
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,879
purchase items or upgrades and while

106
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,319
there is gear and stats to consider you

107
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,040
largely just go and swap out the old

108
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,720
equipment with the new as opposed to

109
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,879
making choices as to what kind of weapon

110
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,519
or piece of armor you want to hold on to

111
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:06,840
an upgrade and even though I am a big

112
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,599
fan of souls likes ditching those

113
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,239
mechanics feels like the right move for

114
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,400
the game that Wukong is trying to be

115
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,360
it's far more forgiving focused on

116
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,079
keeping you in the action rather than

117
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,680
pouring over menus or retracing your

118
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,440
steps to regain your lost currency after

119
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,959
dying and Wukong is a better more

120
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,919
distinctive game for it to be clear

121
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,840
though when I say it's more forgiving I

122
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,639
don't mean that it's any less difficult

123
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,720
than a from Style game in fact I'd go so

124
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,759
so far as to say that between this and

125
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,919
Elden ring shadow of the air tree I had

126
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,639
more difficulty getting through wukong's

127
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,960
toughest

128
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,600
challenges unit as I deemed but at the

129
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,400
same time those challenges never felt

130
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,240
unfair and overcoming some of the

131
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,919
tougher boss fights was always a

132
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,039
satisfying combination of learning their

133
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,960
attack patterns figuring out where I

134
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,120
could maximize My Punishment windows and

135
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,840
tweaking my load out in ways that made

136
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,000
the best use of My Chosen powers

137
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,759
combat in black myth Wukong is simple

138
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:09,000
and elegant thanks in part to some tools

139
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,800
that are really fun to play around with

140
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,759
success hinges on a delicate balance of

141
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,960
twitch reflex style gameplay mixed with

142
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,080
careful Resource Management that largely

143
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,919
revolves around a focus meter which

144
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,520
builds up when you land hits and

145
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,600
perfectly Dodge enemy

146
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,520
attacks you gain a focus Point whenever

147
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,319
that meter fills up which you could then

148
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,880
spend in the middle of a light attack

149
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,440
combo for a varied combo or you can just

150
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,120
use a heavy attack on its own for a

151
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,039
powerful strike that can be charged even

152
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,960
further if two three or even four Focus

153
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,800
points are consumed all at

154
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,240
once you also have access to a small

155
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,160
handful of spells governed by a Mana

156
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,840
meter that are versatile enough to be

157
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,120
useful in a wide array of situations the

158
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,160
immobilized spell for instance freezes

159
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,240
enemies for a short time allowing you to

160
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,960
get in some quick hits and potentially

161
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,960
stagger them to allow for even more free

162
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,639
damage Cloud step turns you into

163
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,120
invisible and creates a Decoy for your

164
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,240
enemies to focus on while you break away

165
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,880
heal up and then hit your foe with a

166
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,000
surprise attack that can crit Rock Solid

167
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,560
briefly turns you into a statue that

168
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,120
will cause an enemy's attack to bounce

169
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,440
right off of you giving you an

170
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,160
opportunity for a Counterattack Ring of

171
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,680
Fire creates a barrier around you that

172
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,560
will initially repel enemies and Grant

173
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,599
you some Health Restoration along with

174
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:20,479
enhancing any stat altering drinks that

175
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,400
you may use while standing inside of it

176
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,120
and finally there's my personal favorite

177
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,960
a pluck of many which lets you make

178
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,000
multiple clones of yourself to all gang

179
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,560
up an enemy at once

180
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,360
separate from that you've also got

181
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,319
Transformations which allow you to morph

182
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,800
into powerful creatures that you've

183
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,639
already bested in battle what's really

184
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,360
cool about these is that they don't cost

185
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,160
any Mana they're tied to a very lengthy

186
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,160
cooldown instead and they turn you into

187
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,039
a totally different character complete

188
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,199
with an all new move set special moves

189
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,680
that use their own Focus meter and more

190
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,440
for example one of the first bosses that

191
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,120
you fight is a wolf with a fiery dual

192
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,680
blade that has a lightning f Dash attack

193
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,319
when you defeat him you'll gain his

194
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,240
transformation and be able to do that

195
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,240
very same Dash attack to your enemies

196
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,120
and once you build up its focus meter

197
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,759
you'll even be able to do a hugely

198
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,639
powerful leaping strike that can ignite

199
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,000
foes and deal damage over time to them

200
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,759
and then finally there are Spirit skills

201
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,199
which are earned by defeating certain

202
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,919
more powerful versions of enemies and

203
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:21,080
absorbing their Essence into your gourd

204
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,879
these are effectively Transformations

205
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,879
that only last for one attack and are

206
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,160
also tied to a fairly lengthy cooldown

207
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,520
but it's great to be able to for example

208
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,039
use the wandering White's powerful

209
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,520
headbutt

210
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,080
attack to get an extra stagger after

211
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,800
immobilizing an enemy these Spirit

212
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,680
skills can also be leveled up which

213
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,400
makes it so that even the early game

214
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,440
Spirits never lose their strength as the

215
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,440
campaign rolls on it's an excellent

216
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,440
blend of options especially when mixed

217
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,560
with some truly incredible boss fights

218
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,759
and Wukong introduces all these elements

219
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,520
at thoughtfully measured pace so I never

220
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,879
felt overwhelmed make no mistake the

221
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,560
destined one is extremely powerful

222
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,000
[Music]

223
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,599
and being in control of him is

224
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,720
definitely a heck of a Power Trip even

225
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,000
beyond the many powers and abilities he

226
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,240
has at his disposal nothing beats the

227
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,319
feeling of just slamming a 50-ft bow

228
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,759
staff down onto an enemy's

229
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,199
head but I still had to be smart with

230
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,199
how I used my spells due to the fact

231
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,680
that Mana restoration is actually very

232
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,199
difficult this is where the resource

233
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,000
management aspect of combat comes into

234
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,080
play I had to carefully consider what

235
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,199
spells were actually worth the Mana cost

236
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,879
whether I should save them for a more

237
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,719
difficult second phase of a fight and

238
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,279
whether or not I could capitalize on the

239
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,958
opportunity if I were to spend the Mana

240
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,799
in the first place for instance even

241
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,599
though it's my most powerful spell I

242
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,240
often had to hold off on casting my

243
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,399
pluck of many spell that duplicates my

244
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,160
character since it has an extremely high

245
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,120
Mana cost if I cast it at a bad time the

246
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,720
boss could simply wipe out all of my

247
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,480
clones with an AOE attack before they

248
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,760
even got a chance to get some damage in

249
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,279
sometimes the adjustment I had to make

250
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,320
when I was stuck on a boss was a simple

251
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,440
change in how I use my abilities and the

252
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,120
the act of coming up with a new strategy

253
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,079
and having it pay off was always

254
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:05,040
extremely

255
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,399
satisfying while boss battles are where

256
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,519
Wukong is at its best there's also a

257
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,000
highly respectable amount of enemy

258
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,200
Variety in its regular fights level

259
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,560
design is of the wide linear variety

260
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,000
usually with a clear main path that

261
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,920
leads from checkpoint to checkpoint but

262
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,680
plenty of opportunities to venture off

263
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,920
that path to discover optional goodies

264
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,600
the rewards for exploration are great

265
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,760
too I found rare crafting materials to

266
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,640
make new weapons and armor special

267
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,600
enemies that drop the new spirit skill

268
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,480
curio items that could Equip to enhance

269
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,440
my build and treasure chests that might

270
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,680
permanently increase my Max Health Mana

271
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,680
or stamina all of which made the time

272
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,880
that I took to find them well spent on

273
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,279
top of that there are also several

274
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,720
secret boss fights to discover key items

275
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,279
with mysterious uses that I still

276
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,399
haven't figured out and plenty of more

277
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,120
reasons to stray from the beaten path

278
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,920
and keep an eye constantly scanning the

279
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,680
environment the main one being that

280
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,000
Wukong is one of the most gorgeous games

281
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,120
I've ever played every environment is

282
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,720
brimming with detail from the chip

283
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,160
pieces of bark on the trees in the

284
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,279
forest to the real-time deformation of

285
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,120
the snow as the destined one moves

286
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,519
through it while dragging his staff

287
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,959
along not only that but the animation is

288
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,040
impeccable too with wonderful touches

289
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,640
and flourishes like the way your

290
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,200
character will do a little hop step when

291
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,040
locked onto an enemy then change to

292
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,720
strafing around them as opposed to just

293
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,519
running straight on while keeping their

294
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,600
head turned the music and sound design

295
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
is fantastic as well with epic drum

296
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,240
thumping battle

297
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,720
themes and melodic flutes and Chimes

298
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,440
adding to the air of Wonder and mystery

299
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,100
as you explore the

300
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,950
[Music]

301
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,560
unknown all that said this game really

302
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,360
would have benefited from a map plain

303
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,120
and simple the lands you explore in

304
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,079
Wukong are beautiful no doubt but

305
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,160
they're far too big and too crammed with

306
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,959
secrets to not give you some sort of

307
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:56,279
navigational help especially the second

308
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,680
and third chapters this along with the

309
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,360
fact that it's aggravatingly hard to

310
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,040
tell what obstacles can actually be

311
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,040
climbed over and what's an invisible

312
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,959
wall can make exploration quite

313
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,760
cumbersome it's a good thing that the

314
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,240
rewards are worth

315
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,450
[Music]

316
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,079
it however it's hard not to feel like

317
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:19,360
all vuk Kong's Splender and detail came

318
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,880
at a great cost I experienced numerous

319
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,160
crashes with one particular Heartbreaker

320
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,760
happening right after defeating an

321
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,880
extremely tough boss that I then had to

322
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,920
defeat again several others were more

323
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,720
minor and would typically happen as I

324
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,639
was loading up a new chapter or fast

325
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,399
traveling to another level but they

326
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,720
eventually add up to a lot of

327
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,160
frustration in addition to that several

328
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,200
times during important cutcenes all

329
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,920
dialogue audio and subtitles would drop

330
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,839
out completely leaving me without any

331
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:46,720
clue as to what was being talked about

332
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,959
and no way to rewatch The cutscene

333
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,440
characters would occasionally switch to

334
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
speaking Chinese all of a sudden despite

335
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,160
me having the audio set to English the

336
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
lip flaps of the English dub often don't

337
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,440
even remotely match what's being spoken

338
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,160
oh thank

339
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,639
M finally then the three Bells

340
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,079
sang disciples

341
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:11,600
come and most of the journal entries you

342
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,399
find along the way haven't even been

343
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,760
localized yet into English the worst

344
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,800
though was one particular fight in which

345
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,360
the boss would plunge me down through

346
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,959
the ground during the transition to its

347
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,959
Final Phase only to have me fall through

348
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,720
the world once I regained control of my

349
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,760
character this kept on happening to the

350
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,199
point where I thought my game was

351
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:30,320
unavoidably bugged and I wouldn't be

352
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,720
able to reach the end but my Insanity of

353
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,199
trying the same thing over and over

354
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:36,000
again eventually yielded a different

355
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,320
result for no discernable reason these

356
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,079
are the kinds of technical problems that

357
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,680
game science will hopefully look to

358
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,839
address in post-launch batches and it's

359
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,120
not outside the realm of possibility as

360
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,399
even cyberpunk 2077 was eventually

361
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,199
whipped into shape after its own buggy

362
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:51,959
launch I hope that those fixes come

363
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,360
swiftly because while I still

364
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,199
wholeheartedly think that the things

365
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:57,600
that black myth Wukong does so right are

366
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,480
worth dealing with those problems I

367
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,000
would love to be able to recommend it

368
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,550
without those

369
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,670
[Music]

370
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,120
caveats as game Sciences debut action

371
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,760
game black myth Wukong is mostly a great

372
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,120
success despite some major technical

373
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,399
black marks and localization issues that

374
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,000
are likely to cause some frustrations at

375
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,680
launch combat is fantastic thanks to a

376
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,120
great balance of careful resource

377
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,160
management and lightning fast twitch

378
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,399
reaction gameplay that tested my skills

379
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,600
as much as Elder ring ever has despite

380
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,360
it being a more traditional action game

381
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,600
than from software style not only that

382
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,399
but there are a ton of exciting boss

383
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,959
battles a great variety of enemies and

384
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,800
the world they inhabit is an absolute

385
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,240
treat for the eyes and ears its story

386
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,279
has its moments but relies a bit too

387
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,639
much on having prior knowledge of the

388
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,279
events of Journey to the West and it

389
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,839
really could have used a map to make its

390
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,519
rewarding exploration measure up to the

391
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,680
strength of the combat all said its

392
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,320
strengths more than carry it through

393
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,519
making black myth Wukong a great action

394
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,040
game that could be even greater if game

395
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,880
science can squash the

396
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,600
bugs for more black myth Wukong make

397
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,920

398
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,680
