1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,839
all right we got to talk about Apple

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,279
intelligence so Apple's made this

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,160
promise this huge thing is coming that's

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,960
going to change everything across their

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,240
whole lineup they've been talking about

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,480
it for a while and I think that promise

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,320
is starting to fade this was first

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,119
announced at WWDC 2024 that was nearly 6

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,240
months ago and it's still not completely

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,920
out yet the new iPhones launched in

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,000
September with exactly zero Apple

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,560
intelligence features but then some

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,039
software updates have started to push

14
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:32,200
out and eventually it's supposed to be

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,160
finished and in everyone's Hands by

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,079
March

17
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,360
2025 that's a lot of buildup so what I

18
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,800
want to do now is review every single

19
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,320
Apple intelligence feature that's out so

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,239
far and then also get into whether the

21
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:49,440
promise that they're actually making is

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,840
even good in the first place so first up

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,719
writing tools so all these features

24
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:55,960
unless otherwise specified are on iPhone

25
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,199
iPad and Mac so no apple intelligence

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,680
features at all on the Vision Pro their

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,360
most futuristic platform that's already

28
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,560
kind of fascinating but the writing

29
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,200
tools you may have heard about these

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,280
since they're definitely referenced a

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,400
lot maybe the most out of any of these

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,320
and yes it's basically generative AI to

33
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,360
help adjust what you've already written

34
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,000
so this is easiest to demo on the Mac

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,640
but basically you have something you've

36
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,400
written you highlight all of it and then

37
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,000
select one of the writing tools and

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,479
actually this is one of the first weird

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,320
hiccups just a strangely repetitive UI

40
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,640
you can access any of the writing tools

41
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,520
in one click right here or hit show

42
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,200
writing tools which again shows the same

43
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,560
list of writing tools okay so I suppose

44
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,040
there's a world where you know you write

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,399
some message to someone and you just

46
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,479
want it to be a little more friendly or

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,680
maybe you've typed out a bunch of stuff

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,640
that needs to be sent in a work email so

49
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,640
you want to get the AI to make it more

50
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,399
professional for you sure I guess so

51
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,560
I've run it through various things that

52
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,159
I've written from you know whole video

53
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,119
scripts to just a bunch of messages and

54
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,560
it works technically I think the the

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,640
friendly mode mostly uses like shorter

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,159
sentences and lots of exclamation points

57
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,520
and then the professional mode kind of

58
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,038
does the opposite like it's it's still

59
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,840
pretty tur but never uses exclamation

60
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,680
points I think maybe concise is the most

61
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,040
useful basically it takes whatever you

62
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,920
highlight and makes it maybe 40% shorter

63
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,879
and then you can hit copy or just

64
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,840
directly replace it if you trust it and

65
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,080
each of these things takes about 3 or 4

66
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,519
seconds to generate entirely on device

67
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:27,400
so it works offline as well the proof

68
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,000
reading is nice because it picks up on

69
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,959
extra things like capitalization and

70
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,400
proper nouns if you really need that on

71
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,280
top of the auto punctuation checker and

72
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,040
then summary or make table would be

73
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,959
really nice for like really large

74
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:44,120
documents but it doesn't seem to want to

75
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,239
work on some of my huge documents that

76
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:49,120
would be nice to summarize or make into

77
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,200
a table so unfortunately even as a

78
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,879
basically a professional writer at this

79
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,599
point I haven't gotten much use out of

80
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,800
writing tools at all so notification

81
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,480
summaries this one to me personally I

82
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,159
have found almost useless basically it

83
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,799
does exactly what it sounds like it does

84
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:07,560
when it's enabled it summarizes your

85
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,879
notifications from each app so if you

86
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:12,040
get a long message from someone or

87
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,840
several notifications in a row from a

88
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,440
single app it will do its best to

89
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,239
condense that all into a single message

90
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,680
to help you kind of get the gist quickly

91
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,239
so no matter how long or how short the

92
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,360
messages are whether it's just a text or

93
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,159
maybe a group chat has absolutely blown

94
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,920
up and you missed a 100 messages it's

95
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,879
going to try to summarize all that into

96
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,000
one or two lines the thing is once I

97
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,200
enable it and started using it it it

98
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,680
basically seems like the notifications

99
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,480
that I'm getting are almost never

100
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,920
benefited from being summarized or

101
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,599
shortened like I've never gotten four

102
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,920
text messages that are perfectly

103
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,680
summarized into a single one and I'm

104
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,040
sure it's possible there are going to be

105
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,439
some instances where it works for people

106
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,360
but it's not just me I've seen lots of

107
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,760
examples online and there's plenty of

108
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,280
memes too of Apple's notification

109
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,680
summaries doing some sometimes hilarious

110
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,079
work some BR stuff so it works and I

111
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:03,280
guess it's good for a laugh once in a

112
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,400
while but yeah this is a feature I

113
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,760
straight up turned off then gen mooji so

114
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,040
okay believe it or not there was some

115
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,879
hype for this one and once again it's

116
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,599
basically exactly what it sounds like

117
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,040
it's it's letting you generate any Emoji

118
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,600
using AI anything you want so let's say

119
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,360
I'm in messages and I want to react to

120
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,320
some message with a very specific emoji

121
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,400
that doesn't exist you would describe an

122
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,199
emoji so you write your text and then

123
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,479
hit create a new Emoji give it about 3

124
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,720
seconds again and it will use generative

125
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,880
AI to create that image for you that's

126
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,440
fun I guess and yes it will sometimes

127
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,919
refuse to make what you ask of it if you

128
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,080
ask for something like crazy or graphic

129
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,440
although it seems to have no problem

130
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,880
making a potato with a gun so that's an

131
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,160
emoji reaction you can send sick it's a

132
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,800
very specific use case there's no doubt

133
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,919
some people will have fun with it I just

134
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,400
think I'm not in the Target demographic

135
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,479
to use this sort of thing all the time

136
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,919
so again over my head cool it exists but

137
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,240
that's it so then image playground is

138
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,199
another maybe kind of weird one this is

139
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,440
almost the same tool but sort of

140
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,160
Standalone this is a playground to

141
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,320
generate images in a cartoon

142
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,000
style of whatever you want so you open

143
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,240
the playgrounds app and again just

144
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,240
describe the image you want in text

145
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,360
anything really but before you type

146
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,840
anything there are also a number of

147
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,280
these buttons down here and they're kind

148
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,000
of just inspiration suggestions for

149
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,280
things or people to include in the image

150
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,400
so yes you can choose any of the people

151
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,880
that your phone recognizes from your

152
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,759
photos app and that'll be the starting

153
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,800
point for the image and then add some

154
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,000
themes or accessories or background or

155
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,800
props or whatever on top of it so here's

156
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,400
me with a hard hat on at a disco and it

157
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,280
generates it again in a few seconds on

158
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,759
device always cartoon style never photo

159
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,360
realistic and it can give you a few

160
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,039
options to choose from and once you hit

161
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:01,120
done you can copy and paste that image

162
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,720
wherever you want Google and a few

163
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,639
others have this on their devices too

164
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,080
just sort of a playground to make some

165
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,880
artificially generated images again it's

166
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,280
of debatable usefulness of course it

167
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,680
makes sense that it won't do

168
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,160
photorealistic images because that would

169
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,599
open up a whole can of worms uh but it's

170
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:20,960
even supposed to not do some things that

171
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,599
could potentially be offensive again

172
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,880
like if you ask it for a gun it

173
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,759
typically refuses but I found if you add

174
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,400
a few more variables like a chef hat and

175
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,720
some fireworks to something then it will

176
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,400
be a little more likely to actually pull

177
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,479
through for you so yeah good thing it

178
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,080
says it's in beta and may create

179
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,080
unexpected results this is yet another

180
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,319
app that they've added to my phone that

181
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,800
I predict that I will probably never use

182
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,919
again after making this video so then

183
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,960
priority notifications so okay now this

184
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,199
is one that I think had some promise or

185
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,639
at least I'm in the Target demographic

186
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,800
for it because as an iPhone and Android

187
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,639
User you start to notice that Apple's

188
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,520
weakness has a long time than

189
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,759
notification management if it was just

190
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,280
kind of had a fire hose of notifications

191
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,199
coming in all the time so priority

192
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,360
notifications surfaces certain

193
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,680
notifications Above the Rest when you're

194
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,000
in a focus mode that reduces

195
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,479
notifications but this should also work

196
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,280
in the mail app to put AI identified

197
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,160
high priority messages up at the top

198
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,520
plus some other categories so if you use

199
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,560
the default mail app which I don't but a

200
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,000
lot of people do then this could be

201
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,080
helpful something Gmail has had for many

202
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,520
years and the reduced notifications mode

203
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,240
mod also specifically tries to do a good

204
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,360
job of only letting important

205
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,039
notifications through but keeping the

206
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:38,560
rest quiet so then the photos app uh yes

207
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,280
we all hate the new photos app everyone

208
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
you do I do everyone you know hates it

209
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,479
we're all on the same page it's terrible

210
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,080
but Apple has added exactly one AI

211
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,039
feature to the photos app and in an age

212
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,639
where lots of companies are comfortable

213
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,800
adding a ton of AI to their photos apps

214
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,680
dozens of things but they've decided all

215
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,520
right yeah we can do the background

216
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,000
object removal thing

217
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,400
we can do that so basically the same

218
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,280
thing as Google's Magic Eraser tool

219
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,599
let's say you've got a picture with a

220
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:05,879
subject in the front and you just want

221
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,199
to remove that annoying thing in the

222
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,280
background you hit the edit button and

223
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,720
then on the right side you hit the

224
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,960
cleanup tool and a lot of times it will

225
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,360
automatically highlight in this sort of

226
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,319
rainbow glow the thing that it auto

227
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,440
detects that you want to remove but if

228
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,919
it doesn't you can just tap or Circle

229
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,240
whatever you want and it takes a few

230
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
seconds and then it just gets rid of it

231
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,080
and use a generative fill to fill in the

232
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,400
background and of course some scenes

233
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,639
work better than others it's kind of the

234
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,639
same deal as Magic Eraser or photoshop

235
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,440
typically patterns or repeating

236
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,559
backgrounds will give you the best

237
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,279
results I'm going to say I actually

238
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,839
think this one works better than Google

239
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,240
it's better at getting a good outline of

240
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,919
the photob bomber or the background

241
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,360
object in a single gesture which is nice

242
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,279
it's really smart so to me this is also

243
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,120
one of the more useful features

244
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,600
recording summaries so okay this one had

245
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,080
promise but then was kind of confusing

246
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,720
to me because when I saw it on the list

247
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,240
I was like oh this I would have loved

248
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,880
this as a student this is amazing just

249
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,160
one place where you can record things

250
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,519
transcribe them and then summarize them

251
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,720
and keep them for later that sounds

252
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,320
amazing but this is not built into the

253
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,760
default voice memos app at all so if

254
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,760
you're on a phone call you can turn on

255
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,920
call recording you hit that little

256
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,519
button down there it'll take a second

257
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,000
it'll warn the person that you're on the

258
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,920
phone with with a little message this

259
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,160
call will be recorded and then from

260
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,760
there it'll record everything that gets

261
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,839
said and transcribe it and the

262
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:25,000
transcriptions are amazing it identifies

263
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,240
each speaker it is accurate I love this

264
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,920
part but then if you care about the

265
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,279
summary part this is where it starts to

266
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,720
get weird again because you go into the

267
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,040
notes app this is where it's saving

268
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,120
everything and it shows up as a new note

269
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,279
and the preview actually summarizes it

270
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,760
right here pretty well but then when you

271
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,000
click in there's a whole transcript

272
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,160
great and then there's another summary

273
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,880
button up here at the top you hit that

274
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,519
and there's a different summary uh and

275
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,880
this one's a little worse the first one

276
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,399
back in the preview actually picked up

277
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,240
and included that I said Ridge wallet

278
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,079
the second one didn't get that at all

279
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:01,959
but did get best bu interesting but

280
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:03,519
Apple why don't you bring this to The

281
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,720
Voice Memos app this is I I want to be

282
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,640
able to sit this down in a lecture or a

283
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,079
meeting and have it record things so I

284
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:10,399
can summarize them later that's like the

285
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,959
main place I figured this would be

286
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,680
useful but it's not there so please

287
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,360
please the only way to initiate this

288
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,279
right now is actually to go through the

289
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,480
notes app to create a new note and then

290
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,079
attach and then create a new recording

291
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:25,680
and then record your audio into there

292
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,720
but it just feels like it could be one

293
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,640
step easier so okay visual visual

294
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,440
intelligence so these last two are kind

295
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,120
of the big ones visual intelligence is

296
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,839
only available on the iPhone 16 and 16

297
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,079
Pro and you get to it by long pressing

298
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,639
that button on the side of those new

299
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,720
phones which opens it up it's that

300
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,320
camera control button and when you open

301
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,160
it up you get a full screen viewfinder

302
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,240
with three buttons a shutter in the

303
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,720
middle then ask on the left and search

304
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,600
on the right so if you point this at any

305
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,839
object or subject and you hit ask that

306
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,320
lets you ask chat GPT anything about

307
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,079
what it sees and if you hit SE search

308
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,480
then it's basically just reverse Google

309
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,600
image searching whatever it sees so chat

310
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,240
gbt or Google so if you hit the shutter

311
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,519
button it snaps a photo and then

312
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,000
continues to give you those two items or

313
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,320
a popup menu where you can again either

314
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,079
search or ask again pretty repetitive if

315
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,320
you ask me but okay while this is a very

316
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,399
pretty UI and it works pretty quickly it

317
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,560
also isn't anything you know

318
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,920
particularly new that we haven't seen

319
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,440
before like I was just watching my

320
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,040
Galaxy S8 review from back in 2017 where

321
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,680
I do a demo of the exact same thing I

322
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,839
take a picture of something in front of

323
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,440
me it looks it up with Bixby Ai and it

324
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,519
could tell you if it was a landmark or a

325
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,639
product that you could shop for this is

326
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,839
going to be more capable obviously chat

327
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,600
GPT has a lot more capabilities and

328
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,120
maybe even a little bit more trust these

329
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,360
days than Bixby had back then and it's

330
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,120
certainly more well integrated but yeah

331
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,720
so it's not something mind-blowing or

332
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,399
groundbreakingly new but it is ideally

333
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,079
more accurate and more capable than

334
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,320
before maybe they're going to continue

335
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,760
to build on top of this in the future

336
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,360
but then there is chat GPT integration

337
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,240
the sort of last but not least new thing

338
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,959
that Siri works with chat GPT I think a

339
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:09,079
lot of people thought there was a lot

340
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:10,560
more to Siri like right off the bat

341
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,200
because it has this new animation and

342
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,160
you see the new Siri animation so you

343
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,120
think it's the new Siri but most of the

344
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,560
new Siri stuff isn't here yet but the

345
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,360
chat GPT stuff is so if you ever make a

346
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,079
request or ask a question that's out of

347
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,600
the normal scope of Siri maybe ask for a

348
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,720
recipe or you ask for it to make a trip

349
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,120
itinerary or something big then it

350
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,800
recognizes it and it can prompt you if

351
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,720
you want to ask chat GPT instead and if

352
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,880
you confirm then it pulls from chat GPT

353
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,600
to respond uh this is all free you don't

354
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,639
need an account for this Apple has

355
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,440
promised all sorts of masking so your

356
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,600
data is not used for training models

357
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,199
open AI doesn't get to collect any of

358
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:50,800
this information about you through the

359
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,519
requests but you can also sign into your

360
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:57,040
chat GPT account if you want to keep a

361
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,760
history of your queries or use higher

362
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,680
end model

363
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,279
or even go over the daily limit of free

364
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,519
queries there's even actually a button

365
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,519
to upgrade to chat GPT plus built into

366
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,480
iOS now so it's pretty well considered

367
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,959
so yeah the new Siri animation might be

368
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,760
fooling some people but really it's

369
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,120
other than being able to type to Siri

370
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,320
more easily there's really not a whole

371
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,160
lot actually new yet with Siri but that

372
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,360
brings me to the rest of the things that

373
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,399
aren't here yet still that are coming

374
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,360
soon with software updates that list is

375
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,120
right here there are more Apple int

376
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,079
elligence features that are in the works

377
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,000
coming soon and honestly Siri is the

378
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,959
main one I'm interested in because it's

379
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:38,240
supposed to be able to take inapp

380
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,880
actions it should be able to reach into

381
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,560
Apps and take action inside of them

382
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,720
which I think could be awesome I think

383
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,040
developers could all update their apps

384
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,519
to work really well with it and it could

385
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,160
be really useful it could differentiate

386
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,079
Siri to actually make it useful again um

387
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:56,480
but yeah that's still coming but yeah

388
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,480
then from there my take is the rest of

389
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,720
the AI stuff really not super amazing or

390
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,240
compelling to me just to be real like

391
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,600
the writing tools that seems like a nice

392
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,399
safe use of generative AI that's the

393
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,040
thing they're sort of talking about the

394
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,519
most but I don't even find myself

395
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,040
needing to rewrite things that often and

396
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,040
like I said I'm not in the Target

397
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,720
demographic to use the image playgrounds

398
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,880
all that much or gen Emojis all the time

399
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,240
the visual intelligence is definitely

400
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,600
super useful like three or four times a

401
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,320
year for me like when some interesting

402
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,279
plant or dog or whatever is in front of

403
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:31,639
me and I want to just figure out what it

404
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,000
is but that's actually funny you

405
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,959
remember the the clip from the Apple

406
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,040
keynote of that person who walks up to a

407
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,680
dog and instead of asking the person

408
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,519
walking the dog what kind of dog it is

409
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,759
they just go hey can I take a picture of

410
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,320
your dog and then they ask the phone

411
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,959
what kind of dog it is instead of just

412
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:47,839
asking the person and that to me is the

413
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,480
perfect encapsulation of so many of

414
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,519
these Apple intelligence features you

415
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,519
could use them and they might work

416
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,920
really well but should you should you

417
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,800
like you can ask for a more friendly

418
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,079
version version of this letter to send

419
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,120
to your

420
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,320
friend or you could try to write it in a

421
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,279
friendly way in the first place

422
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:09,759
like like you can ask Chachi PT to plan

423
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,560
a whole trip for you with an itinerary

424
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,440
and everything and honestly it's really

425
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,680
impressive when it works but are you

426
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,880
actually going to just go in blind and

427
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,600
just follow the AI generated itinerary

428
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,480
if you even like packing like I know

429
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,440
there's two types of people when packing

430
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,920
maybe some people will just follow the

431
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,440
AI generated prompt but I feel like I'm

432
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,399
in the type that kind of wants a little

433
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,680
bit more than that I think luckily no

434
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,720
matter what I'm packing it always fits

435
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,560
in my Ridge travel gear so shout out to

436
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,319
Ridge for sponsoring this portion of the

437
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:41,959
video specifically I helped design the

438
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:43,880
new commuter bag for Ridge and I

439
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,800
actually I've been dailying this

440
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,440
creation for the past couple months we

441
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,839
got it some really good water bottle

442
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,680
holders on the sides now and I also

443
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,360
added a tablet sleeve in the back so if

444
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,399
you've got a tablet and a laptop they

445
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,360
both have their own padded slot and then

446
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,519
I double down when I'm flying because I

447
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,240
also have the ridge c car on which is

448
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,440
basically perfect it's weatherproof it's

449
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,160
rugged it's got you know these aluminum

450
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,519
corner protectors it also has the 360

451
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:08,319
spinning wheels they're super smooth of

452
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:10,040
course it has a slot for a Tracker in

453
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,000
case it's ever separated from you it's

454
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,480
incredibly lightweight it's the go-to

455
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,920
and you already know that they work

456
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,319
perfectly together like a little

457
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:19,199
ecosystem to create a perfect little

458
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,880
travel combo so shout out to Ridge for

459
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,240
sponsoring this portion of the video and

460
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,639
for letting me design some of these

461
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,880
products and some more that are upcoming

462
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,440
so you have to stay tuned for those uh

463
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,759
but if you want to pick up both the

464
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,279
carry-on and the backpack you can get

465
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:35,319
them together at ridge.com MKBHD and get

466
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:36,920
30% off and they also have their Black

467
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,399
Friday sell going on right now but yeah

468
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,519
I think apple is going to build on and

469
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,880
sort of iterate on hopefully all of

470
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,600
these features like we have the sort of

471
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,519
standard set that we're expecting from

472
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,720
them now and this is this is the worst

473
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,160
they'll ever be they will only get

474
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,720
better from here but it is pretty crazy

475
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,639
to see how much emphasis is in all of

476
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,399
the advertising and all the talk about

477
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,720
the newest devices on apple.com as if

478
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,319
Apple intelligence is this massive

479
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:05,839
gamechanging groundbreaking new thing

480
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,319
you know there are parts of it that are

481
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,439
really good I think the background

482
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,280
eraser tool in photos is probably the

483
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,480
best we've seen it's better than

484
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,000
Google's it's really impressive I think

485
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,599
the visual intelligence stuff has

486
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,319
potential to be really good but honestly

487
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,720
the best thing I think we've gotten from

488
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,559
Apple intelligence cuz all the stuff is

489
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,799
running on device is bumping up the base

490
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,039
memory in everything there's more RAM in

491
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:30,480
every iPhone now and the base memory on

492
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,840
every Mac is 16 gigs now which made the

493
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,919
base Mac Mini an incredible deal so

494
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,160
shout out to Apple intelligence for that

495
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,799
either way hopefully a lot more coming

496
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,679
thanks for watching catch you guys in

497
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:45,540
the next one peace

498
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,260
